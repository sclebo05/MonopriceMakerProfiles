# MonopriceMakerProfiles

After purchasing an old Monoprice Maker from someone, I am attempting to migrate settings from legacy Cura profiles to the latest Cura (5.4) and Prusa (2.6.1) slicers.  

## Gcodes
As with any printer, I recommend using the custom Gcodes for your printer.  These can be beneficial in performing a test stripe before each print, which can help with initial layer issues by clearing the nozzle.

## Notes
I am running TH3D Unified 2 firmware from https://support.th3dstudio.com/helpcenter/monoprice-maker-select-firmware/ . This is based on a fairly recent Marlin 2.x
